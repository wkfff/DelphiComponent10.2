It is unnecessary to compile i18nEditor, because i18nEditor.exe is already in 
the 'Bin' folder.

However, if you prefer to build the binary yourself, before opening i18nEditor 
inside Delphi, you must install the Shell Controls package. The Shell Controls 
package is one of the demo packages of Delphi. In Delphi 2010, you can find it 
at the following location:

{PUBLIC DOCUMENTS}\RAD Studio\7.0\Demos\DelphiWin32\VCLWin32\ShellControls
