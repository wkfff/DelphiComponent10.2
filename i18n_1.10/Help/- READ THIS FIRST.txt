The help file of the i18n Package (i18n.chm) is generated using "Doc-O-Matic Express", which is a free
software. Besides my grammatical and spelling mistakes, the following problems are also part of the help 
file:

   1. You will see some broken links or part of XML markups in the help file. Seems "Doc-O-Matic Express" 
      does not like cross file referencing, and even sometimes mess up with in file references.

   2. In the help pages of units you will see some undocumented items. Those items are in the implementation 
      clause of the unit and are not visible. However, "Doc-O-Matic Express" insists to include them in the 
      help. Apparently the commercial version of Doc-O-Matic has an option to turn this annoying feature off. 

   3. Although the class constants appear as the member of their class, but "Doc-O-Matic Express" does not 
      show their documentation. You need to refer to the source code to see the comments.


Thank you!
